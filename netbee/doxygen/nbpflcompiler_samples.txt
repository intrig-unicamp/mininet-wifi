/** \example filtercompiler.cpp

<hr>
<p>This program can be used to see how to interact with the NetPFLCompiler
module. It prints to console the NetIL code generated from NetPFL filtering rule, e.g. 
<tt>'ip.src == 10.0.0.1'</tt> by exploiting the protocol format information read from 
a given NetPDL database.</p>
<p>This program can be used also to simply check the syntax of the filtering string
(according to the NetPFL syntax), without actually generating the NetIL code.</p>
