### About Mininet-WiFi
Mininet-WiFi is a fork of Mininet (http://mininet.org/) which allows the using of both WiFi Stations and Access Points. Mininet-WiFi only add wifi features and you can work with it like you were working with Mininet.

### Things to keep in mind when working with Mininet-WiFi   
* You can use any wireless network tools (e.g. iw, iwconfig, wpa_supplicant, etc)    
* Please consider computer network troubleshooting steps to solve issues before making questions in the mailing list (e.g. is the station associated with ap? Is the OpenFlow rule working correctly? etc)   
* Do you need help? Be careful with questions in the mailing list and please providing as much information you can.

### Building Topologies with GUI

![](https://github.com/ramonfontes/vnd/blob/master/miniedit.png)

I'm a beginner, I do not know Python and I would like to create a customized topology. In this case, both [MiniEdit](https://github.com/intrig-unicamp/mininet-wifi/blob/master/examples/miniedit.py) and [VND](https://github.com/ramonfontes/vnd) can serve as support since they provide a GUI to generate Python scripts. 


### Development
For instructions about easier development check [this helper file](doc/dev_help.md).

## Pre-configured Virtual Machine    
For your convenience, we provide pre-built VM images including Mininet-WiFi and other useful software. The VM images are in .ova format and should be usable with any modern x64 virtualization system.

## Note
Mininet-WiFi should work fine in any Ubuntu distribution from 14.04, but in some cases (only if you have problems when start it) you have to stop _Network Manager_ with either `sudo systemctl stop network-manager` or `sudo service network-manager stop`.
